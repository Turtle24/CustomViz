# CustomViz

## Project At A Glance

End to end custom visualization exploration project. The purpose of this project is to implement an end to end project that allows me to explore visualisation libraries such as brokeh, matplotlib, plotly etc. Setting up an AWS mysql database and essentially hosting everything via technoligies such as Heroku, Google App Engine etc. Exploring html and CSS is also a motivation as I'm curious about how much you can get out of the visualisation libraries as I'm well versed in Power BI and MicroStrategy but the idea of crafting custom visuals is appealing. Finally I want to implement a basic Linear Regression model via Fast API or Flask.
